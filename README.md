# Duplicate Question Detector:
The ipython notebook is working to build a model which will detect duplicate questions if two questions pair are given.  
The dataset used has been taken from: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs">Kaggle: Quora Question Pairs</a>  
You can follow the analysis on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/shrikrishnaparab/find-duplicate-questions-pair">kaggle</a>

## Problem Statement
Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.
